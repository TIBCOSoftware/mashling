// bfc an accounting structure for memory allocation,
// directly inspired by TensorFlows' Best Fit With Coalescing memory allocator, which is a type of buddy memory allocator.
//
// Why is this needed?
// This allocator is needed because it's been shown that:
//	1. allocating and copying data from Host to Device has in fact taken most amount of time.
//	2. allocating memory on CUDA is a blocking call even on the BatchedContext. This has the effect of making extra cgo calls and is inefficient.
//	3. It's more efficient to just allocate a large block of memory upfront and then manage it internally.
//
// Why does this allocator allocate aligned memory?
// For no reason other than performance. CUDA memory are aligned to 32-byte, 64-byte and 128 byte boundaries.
// While it would be significantly easier to manage memory without alignment, some additional book keeping is worth it for the performance gains.
//
// Why is the freelist just a slice of blocks?
// Because I'm generally a not-great programmer, and couldn't get a splay tree or a skip list to work properly. Rotating trees hurt my brain.
// In fact I spent more than 2 weeks getting a splay tree or skip list to test properly. In the end I thought the saner choice
// would be to leave this for any future developers to pick it up.
//
// How does it work?
// It's a bookkeeping system. Everytime memory is requested, it will go to the free list, and grab the blocks required. Any spares is then
// re-inserted into the free list. Spares are rarely used - mainly because they aren't aligned to the blocksizes.
// There is a map which tracks which address is used (and how big the block is);
// There is a map which tracks which addresses are free for use (and how big the block is);
// There is a "shortcut" map which doesn't require an iteration thru the free list for getting free stuff.
// There are two trackers for tracking the amount of frees and alloc calls. If the ratio is past a certain amount, the memories will be coalesced.
//
// How is the bfc used?
// Every VM will have a bfc (or multiple if there are multiple devices). At startup, an analysis of the inserted Program will be run
// which determines how much memory the VM will need to request from the device. The VM then requests TWICE as much memory (for just-in-case).
// Creation of new Tensors will then use call the alloc methods of the VM, for memories.
//
// Is this the Best Memory Book Keeping System?
// Hell No. There are better ones, but I'm not too good at implementing them. Please feel free to upgrade this.
