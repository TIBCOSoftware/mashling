      <description>Creating a recipe A recipe can be created by customizing an existing recipe in https://www.mashling.io/moreRecipes or by using an editor such as VS code enabled with a mashling extension
Adding a recipe to mashling-recipes repo. A recipe should be contained in its own folder under &amp;lsquo;recipes&amp;rsquo; folder. The recipe folder is composed of a gateway json file, README.md, an optional icon image file, optional Gopkg.lock and Gopkg.toml files. In the absence of the icon image file, the default Mashling icon image is used by mashling.</description>
