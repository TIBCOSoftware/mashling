# mashling/cli
> Command line tool for building **Mashling** based gateways.

**Mashling** is a Micro-gateway framework written in Go. It was designed from the ground up to be robust enough for microservices.


## Installation
### Prerequisites
* The Go programming language 1.7 or later should be [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).
* Set GOPATH environment variable on your system
* In order to simplify development and building in Go, we are using the **gb** build tool.  It can be downloaded from [here](https://getgb.io).

### Install Mashling
    go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/mashling/...

### Update Mashling
    go get -u github.com/TIBCOSoftware/mashling/...

## Getting Started
A Mashling gateway is created using the **mashling** CLI tool.  The tool can be used to create a gateway from an existing *mashling.json* or to create a simple base gateway to get you started.  In this example we will walk you through creating the base gateway.

To create the base gateway, which consists of a REST trigger and a simple event handler flow with a log activity, use the following command:


```bash
mashling create myApp

```

Start the base gateway by performing the following commands:

```bash
cd myApp/bin
./myapp
```

- Mashling will start a REST server
- Send GET request to run the flow. eg: http://localhost:9096/pets/2

The base gateway is built with the following mashling.json. It can be edited to add additional triggers and event handlers. A variation of base gateway is called a Mashling recipe. Mashling recipes can be download from mashling.io.

### Build Mashling CLI from source
```
$go get github.com/TIBCOSoftware/mashling/...

$cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/TIBCOSoftware/mashling

[optional, only if building from branch]
$git checkout my_branch

[need to manually go get all dependencies for example:]
$go get github.com/xeipuuv/gojsonschema

$go install ./...
```
Mashling CLI is built and installed in $GOPATH/bin
