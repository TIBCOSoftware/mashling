To get started:

1. Find a recipe that you like. (You can browse the details on each recipe.)
1. Download and run the recipe. (Use the **Try Now** button to download the pre-made Mashling application. Each recipe comes with a README with detailed usage instructions.)
1. Customize your recipe and download and run your own Mashling application.
