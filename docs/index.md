# Getting Started With Project Mashling<sup>TM</sup>


### Getting started with the UI 

Project Mashling comes with a collection of curated recipes for common microgateway patterns searchable on [http://mashling.io](http://mashling.io)

To get started : 

* Find a recipe that is of interest to you

* Browse the details on the recipe

* Use the "Try it now" button to download the corresponding pre-created Mashling application

* Each recipe comes with detailed usage instruction. A recipe README file, as an example [here](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/mashling-recipes/blob/master/recipes/event-dispatcher-router-mashling/README.md) 

* You can also customize each recipe and download the corresponding recipe file directly


### Getting started with CLI

To create a mashling application via the CLI, refer to the detailed [README](https://github.com/jpollock/mashling/blob/master/cli/README.md) on the Project Mashling repo in the cli folder
